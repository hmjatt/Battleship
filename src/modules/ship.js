	//create gameGrid() helper function that generates a grid of 10 x 10

	// create a random ship size variable

	//create placeShip() helper function that takes grid, size of ship
	// places a ship at a random position on grid, outputs ships co-ordinates


	//////////// test code till here /////////////



	//create hit() helper function that takes a 
	// number and then marks that position as ‘hit’

	//create isSunk() helper function should be a function that calculates it 
	// based on their length and whether all of their positions are ‘hit’





	// REMEMBER you only have to test your object’s public interface. 
	// Only methods or properties that are used outside of your ‘ship’ 
	// object need unit tests.

	// Your 'ships' will be objects that include their length,
	// where they’ve been hit and whether or not they’ve been sunk.
